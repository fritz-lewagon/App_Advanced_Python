# APP_Group-Project
A repository for our group project in advanced python programming.
The game "CatchMe" was developed by Constantin Preuss-Neudorf, Maximilian Gokell, Nicole Vollmer, Stephanie Caloz, and Friedrich Finken.
We have a game class that runs the main game logic and handles the graphical output. Objects within the game class are spawned from the ball and danger class that inherit the object class. The main class is used to start the game.
